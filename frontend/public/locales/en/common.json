      "question": "How is Donations Tracker different from other product-sharing websites?",
      "answer": "Although there is the option to sell/purchase items on this website, Donations Tracker stands out from other product-sharing platforms in the sense that it promotes donation sharing. The development team realized that despite there being numerous platforms to sell/purchase products, there is a lack of donation-promoting websites. By making donations more accessible, Donations Tracker hopes to enhance community morale and well-being."

      "question": "What is the difference between registering as <1>an individual vs. organization?</1>",
      "answer": [
        "Registering as an individual doesn't require that the user be associated with an organization (e.g. NGO, company). There are no geographic restraints for individual users (i.e. individual users don't have to be living in the Greater Montréal area). However, individual users can only offer donations/products (not request).",
        "Registering as an organization makes it mandatory that the user be associated with a legitimate organization. The legitimacy of the organization will be approved by the website administrators during registration. For the purpose of the website, for now, it is required that the organization be based in the Greater Montréal area. Organization users can make both offers and requests."

    "item_7": {
      "question": "How can users be sure that the website is secure?",

        "As a group of university students behind this website, we understand that the security of this platform could be questionable. Our web development team has worked vigorously to ensure that your privacy and authentication information is managed safely on our platform. Some of the methods that we have implemented to ensure you have a safe and secure experience are listed below.",
        "If a user registers as an organization, website administrators will go through a mandatory authentication process to ensure that the organization is legitimate. Only then will the registration be completed, and the user would be able to use the website",
        "If you have reasonable doubt about another user's reliability/legitimacy, you can always report them by clicking on the <1>Report User</1> button, which can be found on the _____. Once a user has been reported, their activity will be temporarily blocked until the website administrators conduct a background check."

    "item_8": {
      "question": "If there are issues/errors with donations or monetary transactions, what should we do?",
      "answer": [
        "We completely understand that issues with donations/transactions may arise due to various causes (e.g. technical difficulties). <3>Donations Trackers is not responsible for any errors/issues that arise with a transaction/donation.</3> Such errors/issues include but are not limited to:",
